# movie-trailers-website

Hello guyz 

soo if you want to create a simple website that displays videos (movie trailers in my case), 

all you have to do is download the movies folder from my repo and open the entertainmentcentre.py in the editor

give the details of the videos, by creating objects of media class. 

at last, we call the method named open_movies_page from a js combined code fresh_tomatoes.py which i got it from instructor.

this looks over the frontend and makes our website attractive.

thank you..
