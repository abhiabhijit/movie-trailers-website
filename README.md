# movie-trailers-website
Hello guyz 

soo if you want to create a simple website that displays videos (movie trailers in my case), 

all you have to do is download the movies folder from my repo and open the entertainmentcentre.py in the editor

give the details of the videos, by creating objects of media class. 

at last, we call the method named open_movies_page from a js combined code fresh_tomatoes.py which i got it from instructor.

this looks over the frontend and makes our website attractive.

#quotes.py

this python code checks whether the txt file that you have used contains any alerted words(shit used in case of shot)

#search_trailer

this code is used to search fora youtube video.

#take_a_break.py

this python code is used to refresh yourself from long works by displaying a video in respective time intervals ..

thank you..
